                About Me
            </h1>
            <p >
                <h3>üë®‚Äçüéì Academic Background</h3>
                I‚Äôm Apoorv Sharma, originally from Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. I have pursued my Bachelor of technology in CSE
                <br>from UPES‚ÄîUniversity of Petroleum and Energy Studies. My specialization is in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, 
                <br>and I‚Äôve Secured a CGPA of 8.2. Alongside AI/ML, I‚Äôm have also completed a minor in Cloud Computing, which helped me 
                <br>understand scalable architectures and modern development workflows. My academic journey had been shaped by curiosity, 
                <br>rigorous learning, and a desire to create meaningful impact through intelligent systems. I constantly explore new technologies 
                <br>to deepen my understanding and stay ahead in this dynamic field.
                <br><br>
                <h3>üè´ Schooling & Early Leadership</h3>
                Before college, I spent my formative years at Doon International School, where I studied from class 6 to 12 as a boarding student. 
                <br>Those years taught me discipline, resilience, and a strong sense of independence. I was fortunate to serve as the Sports Captain 
                <br>during my time there, which helped me hone leadership qualities and taught me how to motivate and manage a team. Balancing academics 
                <br>with extracurriculars shaped my personality and gave me the confidence to take initiative. Boarding life also exposed me to diverse 
                <br>perspectives, which still influence how I approach learning and collaboration today.
                <br><br>
                <h3>üíª Passion for Tech & Problem Solving</h3>
                I‚Äôm deeply passionate about technology and love tackling complex problems with thoughtful, innovative solutions. Whether it's experimenting 
                <br>with machine learning models or understanding cloud infrastructure, I enjoy getting hands-on and learning by doing. Problem solving 
                <br>excites me‚Äîit's like uncovering the logic that powers the world. I keep myself updated with tech trends and actively look for ways to 
                <br>apply what I learn to real-world scenarios. My enthusiasm for the field drives me to build, break, and rebuild‚Äîalways with the goal of 
                <br>growing stronger and sharper as a tech enthusiast.
                <br><br>
                <h3>üß† Growth Mindset & Openness to Learn</h3>
                Learning never stops for me. I‚Äôm always open to expanding my skill set‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs refining my coding practices, diving deeper into neural 
                <br>networks, or even exploring new tools outside my comfort zone. I approach every challenge as a chance to grow, and I believe that adaptability 
                <br>is just as important as expertise. With a mindset geared toward learning, I welcome feedback, seek out mentors, and share my knowledge with 
                <br>others whenever I can. As someone who values both precision and curiosity, I see each project as an opportunity to stretch my potential.
